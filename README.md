# Cipher-paradigm
The cipher paradigm encompasses encryption by different techniques at different levels.

A program in C  which will take a string as input and will perform following encipherments step
by step and will print the final output. Also the program will print intermediate output as well after every
cipher. All keys can be implicitly defined though thats merely a choice. Also all ciphers are functions.
